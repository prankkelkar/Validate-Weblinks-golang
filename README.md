#### Validate weblinks.


## Description
This repo validates weblinks at https://www.ibm.com/community/z/open-source-software/


Interesting thing to note, with sequential execution it takes around 4 minutes to check all the links present on the webpage but using go concurrency the time is reduced to mere 20 seconds.
